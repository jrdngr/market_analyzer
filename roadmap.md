# Short Term
* Add Rayon to backend and implement for aggregate calcs
* Figure out if gamma aggregate calculation is actually right
* Option to plot calls and puts separately
* Plot gamma changes day to day
* Add vanna
* Permanent storage of options data
* Dockerize and deploy remotely
* Fix outlier coloring. NDX map is useless with a single massive strike


# Long Term
* Resizable graphs
* Grid-based graphs
* Gamma map time slices show changes to gamma over time 


# Complete
* ~~Gamma map graph where x=time, y=price~~
* ~~Basic bar chart for gamma exposure by price~~
* ~~Replace lines with gradient on gamma map~~
* ~~Update data on gamma map~~
* ~~Fix price bars on gamma map~~
