* Run on raspberry pi
* Add Rayon to backend and implement for aggregate calcs
* Option to plot calls and puts separately
* Add vanna
* Permanent storage of options data
* Dockerize and deploy remotely
* Fix outlier coloring on gamma map. NDX map is useless with a single massive strike
* Hybrid gamma map. Aggregate background gradient, per-strike lines
* Market internals summary
* Resizable graphs
* Grid-based graphs
* Gamma map time slices show changes to gamma over time 
* Vertical exposure chart with real-time price. Maybe some form of historical price tracking.


# Complete
* ~~Gamma map graph where x=time, y=price~~
* ~~Basic bar chart for gamma exposure by price~~
* ~~Replace lines with gradient on gamma map~~
* ~~Update data on gamma map~~
* ~~Fix price bars on gamma map~~
* ~~Figure out if gamma aggregate calculation is actually right~~
